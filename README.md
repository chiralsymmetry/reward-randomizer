# Reward Randomizer - Build Habits with Intermittent Rewards

Reward Randomizer is a light-weight Android app designed to help you build and
reinforce habits using an intermittent reward system. By harnessing the power
of intermittent rewards, the app motivates and encourages you to engage in
various activities and create positive habits.

## Key Features:

- Customizable Activities: Create and customize your own activities by simply
  specifying a question and an answer. You can add questions that prompt you to
  perform certain tasks or engage in specific behaviors.

- User-Created Rewards: For each activity, you have the flexibility to define
  your own rewards. Whether it's a simple "Good job!" or a more enticing "Get
  a treat!", you can tailor the rewards to match your preferences and provide
  the positive reinforcement you need to stay motivated.

- Intermittent Reward System: When you have performed your activity and press
  the corresponding button, Reward Randomizer introduces an element of chance.
  There's a slight probability (1-in-6 by default) that one will be chosen of
  the rewards you created for the activity. This intermittent reward system
  keeps you engaged and excited, as you never know when you'll receive a
  reward.

- Dark Mode: Reward Randomizer supports dark mode, which can be enabled in the
  app's settings.

- Localized: Reward Randomizer is available in English and Swedish. The app
  automatically detects your device's language and displays the appropriate
  language.

- Free: No ads, no user-tracking, no cost, and fully open source.

Whether you want to establish a workout routine, study more frequently, or
engage in any other positive behavior, Reward Randomizer is here to support
you. By incorporating an intermittent reward system and personalizing your
activities and rewards, the app keeps habit-building fun, engaging, and
effective.

Download Reward Randomizer now and embark on a journey of habit formation and
personal growth!

Intermittent rewards play a significant role in the formation and maintenance
of habits, and their neurobiological underpinnings can be explained through
several key processes in the brain. Habit formation involves the integration
of neural circuits within the basal ganglia, a set of interconnected
structures involved in reward-based learning and habit formation. The
neurobiological mechanisms underlying intermittent rewards and habit formation
can be described as follows:

- Dopamine signaling: Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role
  in reward processing and reinforcement learning. When we receive an
  unexpected reward or experience a positive outcome, dopamine neurons in the
  brain are activated and release dopamine into specific regions, such as the
  nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Intermittent rewards, or rewards that are not
  consistently given, have been found to produce a stronger dopamine response
  compared to predictable rewards. This dopamine release reinforces the neural
  connections associated with the behaviors leading to the reward, promoting
  habit formation.

- Prediction error and learning: Intermittent rewards create a pattern of
  unpredictable reinforcement, leading to a phenomenon called prediction error.
  Prediction error refers to the difference between the expected and actual
  outcome of a situation. When an unexpected reward is received, dopamine
  neurons signal a positive prediction error, enhancing the synaptic
  plasticity and strengthening the connections between the neurons involved in
  the behavior that led to the reward. This reinforcement of neural pathways
  facilitates the development of habits.

- Neuroplasticity and synaptic strengthening: Intermittent rewards contribute
  to the process of synaptic strengthening, which is the long-term potentiation
  of neural connections. When a behavior is intermittently rewarded, it
  triggers a cascade of molecular and cellular events that result in the
  strengthening of synapses involved in the neural circuitry of that behavior.
  This synaptic plasticity is driven by various factors, including increased
  neurotransmitter release, changes in receptor sensitivity, and structural
  changes in dendritic spines. Over time, these strengthened synapses become
  more efficient and automatic, leading to habitual behaviors.

- Involvement of the prefrontal cortex: The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is another
  critical brain region involved in habit formation. It is responsible for
  decision-making, planning, and goal-directed behaviors. Intermittent rewards
  modulate the activity and connectivity between the PFC and the basal ganglia,
  facilitating the transition from goal-directed actions to habitual behaviors.
  The PFC is involved in evaluating the value of rewards and updating
  action-outcome associations based on the prediction error signal from
  dopamine neurons.

Overall, the neurobiological underpinnings of intermittent rewards and habit
formation involve the interplay between dopamine signaling, prediction error,
synaptic plasticity, and the integration of neural circuits within the basal
ganglia and prefrontal cortex. These processes enable the development of
automatic and repetitive behaviors driven by the anticipation and pursuit of
intermittent rewards.

### tl;dr

Intermittent rewards are crucial for habit formation and maintenance. The brain
learns new behavior best when dopamine is released, and it turns out that
intermittent (unexpected) rewards leads to more dopamine being released and
hasten the transition of an action from being goal-directed to being habitual.
